### Pr_occupancy_season.R() estimates the probability that an individual of a species will be 
##### within the specified extent (lat_input_min, lat_input_max, lon_input_min, lon_input_max)
### mc is the number of iterations to run to estimate the uncertainty distribution
### posts_lat and posts_lon are the formatted posterior distributions for the estimated lat and long 
##### coordinates for each time step of the movement model
### N is the number of species; season_length is the number of time steps in the movement model
### There are four versions that can be specified (method), which deal with uncertainty differently
##### 'JAGS' extrapolates with full uncertainty; 'individual' only includes uncertainty from estimating 
##### the proprotion of individuals who likely crossed into the specified extent; 'time_step' only includes 
##### uncertanity from estimating locations for each time step in the movement model; 'fast' starts with 
##### posterior means to get rapid point estimates
